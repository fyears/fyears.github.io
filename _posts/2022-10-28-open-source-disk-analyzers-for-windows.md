These days I find my disks almost full, and want to find some tools to scan my disks and find out the large files that occupy the space.

After some simple searches, some free software are found. However, it seems that they are not open source, although some of them are free (of prices).

So I make some deeper searches. Finally, I find out two analyzers are provided by the open source community:

## WinDirStat

[WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/) is quite old software, latest updated in year 2018 (**4 years before**)! But actually it works and prints a treemap, although not running fast.

## FileLight

[FileLight](https://apps.kde.org/filelight/) is a sub-project provided by KDE, and surprisingly have a Windows build. Notice that the website provides a link to Microsoft Store, but also provides a link for directly downloading the offline installer.
